## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Robust Note Management (CRUD)
- **Create:** Create notes with mandatory **Title** and **Content**, plus subject categorization and color labels.
- **View:** Clean card layout displaying note subject badges, title, content, color labels, and timestamp.
- **Edit:** Dedicated interactive **Edit Modal** to update titles, subjects, and contents in-place without duplicating records.
- **Delete & Trash Protection:** Safe deletion with confirmation dialog moving notes to **Trash**, allowing easy restoration or permanent deletion.

### 2. Validation & User Feedback
- Comprehensive client-side validation requiring non-blank titles and note contents with whitespace trimming.
- Non-intrusive inline validation banners and animated toast notifications for all user actions.

### 3. Organization & Filtering
- Categorize by subjects (e.g., DBMS, Operating Systems, Mathematics).
- Color-coded labels: 🔴 Important, 🟡 Work, 🔵 Personal, 🟢 Ideas.
- Custom folder creation for semester or course segregation.
- Quick search across titles, contents, and subjects.

### 4. Accessibility & UI
- Fully responsive across desktop and mobile screens.
- **Dark Mode** toggle with local storage persistence.
- Safe DOM construction (`textContent`) to prevent XSS.
